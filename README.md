# How can I trust this

This app was originally a command line tool created to find my own LBP2 levels in LittleBigArchive, because it was quite impossible to search through 7000 folder just to find one level. I thought it would be cool to build a GUI and share it with LBP community. 

**But windows defender is telling me this app is dangerous**

The app used to bind enter key with the search button so its more convenient to search.. and that was a dangerous crime according to windows defender. Windows defender though I used this app as a [Keylogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_logging) so I had to remove the bind. It shouldn't tell you about it now, this is just in case someone is having it. I'm actully struggling to understand Windows defender. if Windows told you this app is from an unknonw publisher you can just press ***show more details*** than press run anyways.
