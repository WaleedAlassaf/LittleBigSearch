Theres a **MacOS** and **Linux** version of this app. you can find them in the [release](https://github.com/WaleedAlassaf/LittleBigSearch/releases/tag/1.1.4) section.


# How do I use this?

if you don't have any level archive you can get the one you like from [LittleBigArchive](https://archive.org/download/LBP-main-community-archive/Little%20Big%20Planet%20Community%20Archive/)

**when you open LittleBigSearch**

1. Press the settings button.

2. Select your Levels archive from the **Browse Archive** button. ex: C:\Users\User\Desktop\LBP2 Levels Archive\PS3\SAVEDATA.

3. Select your destination folder from **Select Destination** button. ex: C:\Users\User\Desktop\RPCS3\dev_hdd0\home\00000001\savedata.

5. Pick any level you want by pressing on the level cell, the app will move the level folder to your destination folder automatically.

6. start LBP and go to your moon, press ***Square*** on any empty spot -> ***import***. 

`NOTES:` 

`• You can use this app for LittleBigPlanet 1, 2 and 3.`

`• The first search will take longer time`

# How can I trust this

This app was originally a command line tool created to find my own LittleBigPlanet 2 levels in LittleBigArchive, as searching through 7000 folders just to locate one level was near impossible. I then decided to develop a graphical user interface to make it more user-friendly and share it with the LBP community.

# I can't start LittleBigSearch on my Mac

MacOS will tell you that this app is from an unidentified developer and it will prompt you to delete it. inorder to tag my name as an identified developer I would need to pay 99$ annually for Apple which isn't feasible for me. You can start the app anyway by going to: System Preferences > Security & privacy > General and than you can press "Open Anyways".

# I can't start LittleBigSearch on my ARM based Mac

I don't have an arm based Mac to test this but I'm pretty sure [Rosetta](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861) will make it start just as good as x86.
